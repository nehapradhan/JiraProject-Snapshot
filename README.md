An email to follow up with the client to discuss the deliverables of the project


Dear Mia, 
  
I trust this email finds you in good health and high spirits. Thank you for taking out time for the online meeting today to discuss the requirements for revamping your restaurant.  
When managing a restaurant business having the most delicious food is not always enough to get people through the door. I had a meeting with my team and according to our research we know that your restaurant has talented chefs and superb ambiance. However, your business has been adversely affected by COVID-19 pandemic and after going through your sales record and accounts of your restaurant, we realised that your business is struggling to create revenue. 
Based on our understanding and the prerequisites provided by you, I along with my team led by our Senior Business Analyst Ms. Susmita Khadka have come up with extensive strategies for Mia’s Restaurant Project and would like to propose a set of solutions to help you regain 80% of your customers and establish a sustainable path forward.  
Creating Website with Online Ordering System 
I cannot stress enough how important it is to create an online presence in today’s competitive market. We have proposed developing a user-friendly website for your restaurant as one of the crucial deliverables with Online Ordering System which will enable customers to place an order at their own convenience without the hassle of leaving home or waiting in line at a restaurant. The website will have a secure method of payment and will be compatible for both Android and IOS devices. The admin section of the website will have a dashboard to monitor and track customer’s activities on the website which will eventually assist us to gather more information about our customer’s preferences and can be used for collaborative filtering for recommending more items to our customers to increase the sales for the business.  
Digital marketing 
Engaging with the audience and customer’s is equally important when running any business. We need to promote your business by creating digital content and adverts over various social media platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and create an active social media presence. For instance, we can start by creating an engaging profile of Mia’s Restaurant with appealing content that reflects your business’s values, background and other important details such as the menu, pricing, ingredients of the dishes served and location of the restaurants. We can increase customer engagement by conducting surveys and polls over these social media platforms to get customer’s feedback and improve the restaurant’s services.  Customers can be notified about various promos and deals through emails and social media platforms. 

Collaboration and Partnerships 
By collaborating and creating partnerships with influencers we have to explore catering opportunities and it is also a great idea to participate in local events and markets by having our pop-up stalls for food tasting to enhance visibility making customers acquainted with our restaurants’ special dishes.  
Customer Retention Program 
Introducing loyalty programs with discounts is also immensely helpful for retaining customers and improving customer satisfaction. For instance free coffee or other services can be delivered when customers collect enough points or vouchers. Sending automated emails to customers who sign up for loyalty programs during their birthdays with free vouchers can be done to retain customers. 
  
Please let me know what time suits you the best to arrange another online meeting for answering your queries and please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to accommodate any other changes to the proposal to gauge a fit to your project. I am committed to supporting you in revitalizing your business.
